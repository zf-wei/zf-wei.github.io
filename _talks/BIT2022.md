Title: Bound Return Probabilities via Spectral Embedding.

Abstract: 
For simple random walk on a cycle graph with odd number of vertices, ergodic theorems of Markov chains tell us that return probabilities satisfy
    $$\lim_{t\to\infty}p_t(x,x)=\tfrac{1}{n},$$
    where $n$ is the number of vertices of the cycle and $p_t(x,x)$ is the probability that simple random walk started at a vertex $x$ of the cycle is back at $x$ on step $t\geqslant 1$.


In this talk, we will consider general regular graphs and give a sharp bound on convergence rate: the return probabilities of simple random walk on a regular non-bipartite graph $G$ (with $n$ vertices) satisfies
    $$\abs{p_t(x,x)-\tfrac{1}{n}}\leqslant \tfrac{18}{\sqrt{t}}$$
    for $t\geqslant 1$ and each vertex $x$ of $G$.


Our main tool is the method of ``spectral embedding". Bounds on eigenvalues of random walk transition matrices will also be given as a byproduct. We will try making this talk friendly to a wider audience in Mathematics: only a background of linear algebra and calculus is assumed.
