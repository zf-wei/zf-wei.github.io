During 2024 Spring semester, I led the recitations supervised by [Kent Orr](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=6021).

My performance has received high praise from Kent. In his email to me on March 19, Kent wrote: "Thanks again for being the best AI I've had since I arrived at IUB in 1992! And I've had a lot of great AIs!" This acknowledgment underscores my effectiveness and the positive impact I bring to my interactions.
