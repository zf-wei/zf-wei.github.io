During 2022 Fall semester, I taught sections 4074 and 4075 of M-018 independently, under the supervision of [Annie Edwards](https://math.indiana.edu/about/faculty/edwards-annie.html).

### What did you like most about this course and instructor?

He helped students through problems and confusion regularly.

He's incredibly helpful and enjoys what he does.

I could tell from pretty early on he wanted us to succeed and did his best to help us succeed.

I liked how kind the instructor was. I also liked that this was only an 8 week course and there was a light homework load.

I appreciated the fact that Zhifeng was patient when teaching, uploaded all the notes to canvas, and answered emails quickly and clearly.

Zhifeng is a very nice and respectful man. He feels easily approachable and he truly has a passion for what he does.

He always answered the questions everyone had and always was fast to answer emails.

I like how the instructor took to explain the same problem when a student was confused or didn't understand.
 
I liked how you would go through the answers to the homework quiz after you collected the papers. I found that really helpful because that
made me understand my mistakes.

I liked how invested Zhifeng was in helping all of the students understand the material. I also enjoyed that he asked if anyone
had any questions or concerns after mostly every step in the lessons.

I liked how everything was done in a consistent way that made sense. It made things easier to comprehend.

He was beyond helpful. Great Teacher.

Zhifeng was always available to ask questions and was enthusiastic about answering them.

Zhifeng made sure that we understood the material before moving on to the next subject.

He is a nice guy

I really liked how you take the notes on the iPad and upload it onto the screen so we can see a visual. I am someone who learns
well by examples so that helped me learn better. I also liked how you can tell that Zhifeng wants us to do our best on tests
and quizzes and he tries to help us out as much as possible. He is also knows his material very well so when we have a question
to ask, he always has an answer for us.

I liked how he explained the notes and how he made examples of all the type of equations that could possibly be a possibility.
