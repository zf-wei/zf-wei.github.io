Greetings! This is **Zhifeng Wei**. Starting from August 2024, I am a postdoctoral fellow at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). My CV could be found [here](https://zf-wei.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

Before joining PNNL, I received my PhD in the [Mathematics Department at Indiana University](https://math.indiana.edu/) in June 2024. My doctoral advisor is [Prof. Russell Lyons](https://rdlyons.pages.iu.edu/). I got my MSc degree in June 2018 at [Beijing Normal University](http://math.bnu.edu.cn/) under the guidance of [Prof. Mu-Fa Chen](http://math0.bnu.edu.cn/~chenmf/main_eng.htm). From September 2011 to June 2015, I went to [Cuiying Honors College](http://chc.lzu.edu.cn/), [Lanzhou University](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Heping Zhang](http://mathteacher.lzu.edu.cn/system/teacherprofileqtenglish/content.jsp?id=154).

My Erdős number is 3, through the following collaboration path: Wei $\longleftrightarrow$ Heping Zhang $\longleftrightarrow$ Peter Che Bor Lam $\longleftrightarrow$ Paul Erdős.

From May 2023 to March 2024, I interned at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), under the supervision of [Dr. Pablo Moriano](https://pmoriano.com/)and [Dr. Ramakrishnan Kannan](https://ramkikannan.com/). My internship was supported by the [GRO Program](https://education.ornl.gov/gro/) and  the [NSF-MSGI program](https://orise.orau.gov/nsf-msgi/).

My name is **魏志峰** in Chinese. In my publications, my name is usually written as **Zhi-Feng Wei**, following suggestions by Prof. Mu-Fa Chen. Click [here](http://math0.bnu.edu.cn/~chenmf/files/SciPopul/19Name-of-Chinese.pdf) to read an article written by Prof. Chen for explanations.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking and reading. [The Story of the Stone (**红楼梦**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber) is my favorite novel. I also like playing jigsaw puzzles: some of my works could be found [here](https://zf-wei.github.io/posts/2021/12/puzzles/).
