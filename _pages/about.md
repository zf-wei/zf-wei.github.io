Greetings! I am a PhD Candidate in the Mathematics Department at Indiana University. My advisor is [Prof. Russell Lyons](https://rdlyons.pages.iu.edu/).

Before coming to Bloomington, I got my MSc degree in 2018 at [Beijing Normal University](http://math.bnu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Mu-Fa Chen](http://math0.bnu.edu.cn/~chenmf/main_eng.htm). I went to [Lanzhou University](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/) for my [college](http://chc.lzu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Heping Zhang](http://mathteacher.lzu.edu.cn/system/teacherprofileqtenglish/content.jsp?id=154).   

My name is written as 魏志峰 in Chinese. In my spare time, I enjoy reading.<!--[Dream of the Red Chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber) is my favorite novel.--> I also like playing jigsaw puzzles: some of my works could be found [here](https://zf-wei.github.io/posts/2021/12/puzzles/).
