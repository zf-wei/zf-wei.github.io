Greetings! I am a PhD student in the Mathematics department at Indiana University. My advisor is [Prof. Russell Lyons](https://rdlyons.pages.iu.edu/).

Before coming to Bloomington, I got my MSc degree in 2018 at Beijing Normal University under the supervision of [Prof. Mu-Fa Chen](http://math0.bnu.edu.cn/~chenmf/main_eng.htm). I went to [Lanzhou University](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/) for my college, advised by Prof. Heping Zhang.   

My name is written as 魏志峰 in Chinese. In my spare time, I enjoy reading. [Dream of the Red Chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber) is my favorite novel. I’m also a dissectologist: some of my works could be found here.
