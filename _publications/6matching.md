## Abstract

We count the number of matchings of order no more than six in $(4, 6)$-fullerene graphs. With a new recurrence method, closed formula for the number of matchings is obtained, based on the number of hexagon faces and some other structural indices.  As preparation, we give a structural classification of $(4, 6)$-fullerene graphs and several induction results in $(4,6)$-fullerene graphs from local to global structure.
