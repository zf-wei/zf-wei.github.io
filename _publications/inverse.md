## Abstract

For continuous-time Markov chains, we provide criteria for non-ergodicity, non-algebraic ergodicity, non-exponential ergodicity, and non-strong ergodicity. For discrete-time Markov chains, criteria for non-ergodicity, non-algebraic ergodicity, and non-strong ergodicity are given. Our criteria are in terms of the existence of solutions to inequalities involving the $Q$-matrix (or transition matrix $P$ in time-discrete case) of the chain. Meanwhile, these practical criteria are applied to some examples, including a special class of single birth processes and several multi-dimensional models.
